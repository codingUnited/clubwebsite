    <div class="content text-black text-2xl mb-4">
      <p>No. You do not need to be an expert. However, this club is not a beginner tutorial series. You should be willing to learn by building, asking questions 
        and taking ownership of small tasks. Members at all levels participate, but everyone contributes to real projects.</p>

    <summary  class="text-black text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Is this a Learning Club or a Project Club?</summary>
    <div class="content text-black text-2xl mb-4">
      <p>It is a project-first club. Learning happens through active development, not passive coursework. Tutorials, lectures, and crash courses exist only
        to support ongoing project work.</p>

    <summary  class="text-black text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What Kind of Projects Does the Club Work On?</summary>
    <div class="content text-black text-2xl mb-4">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">We focus on real, end-to-end systems, including:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Games (Using engines like Godot)</li>
        <li>Embedded and IoT Builds (Such as the Roku Remote Project)</li>
        <li>Deterministic AI Systems (Logic- and Decision-Based, Not Hype-Driven)</li>
        <li>Full-Stack Web Applications and Deployments (Using Django, Flask, React, TailwindCss)</li>
        <li>Infrastructure and Homelab Projects (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Projects are selected base on workforce relevance, not trends.</p>

    <summary  class="text-black text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Do You Use AI Tools in the Club?</summary>
    <div class="content text-black text-2xl mb-4">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Yes. AI tools are part of modern software work, and we treat them as such.</p>
      <p>Members are expected to use AI intentionally and responsibly, and to understand and explain the systems they build.
        AI is a productivity tool, not a substitute for reasoning or fundamentals.</p>

    <summary  class="text-black text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How is Progress Measured?</summary>
    <div class="content text-black text-2xl mb-4">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Progress is measured by:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Working Demos</li>
        <li>Clear Explanations of System Designs</li>
        <li>Documented Decisions and Tradeoffs</li>
        <li>Team Contributions and Reliability</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Certificates, course completion, or tool lists alone are not considered progress.</p>

    <div class="content text-black text-2xl mb-4">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Yes, but they are supporting tools, not the main activity.</p>
